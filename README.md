# AWS-BGP-SITE-TO-SITE-VPN

This project is a walkthrough of an **AWS BGP Site-to-Site VPN** setup, based on the original work by **Adrian Cantrill**, used under the MIT License. 
It demonstrates how to establish a **highly available, BGP-based VPN connection** between AWS and an on-premises network. 
In this project I will be creating an initial AWS environment with 2 subnets, 2 EC2 instances, a TGW and VPC attachment and a default route pointing at the TGW. 
The simulated on-premises environment - 1 public subnet, 2 private subnets. The public subnet has 2 Ubuntu + strongSwan + Free VPN endpoints.

## STAGE ONE

- To first create the intial environments click on the provided [1-click deployment link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-hybrid-bgpvpn/BGPVPNINFRA.yaml&stackName=ADVANCEDVPNDEMO). Make sure to login to an AWS account with full admin permission and you're using the us-east-1 region. Once you clicked on the link scroll down to the bottom, check the box, and click create stack.
Make sure the stack has moved to a **create complete** state before moving on.

- Next we are going to be creating two customer gateway objects. These objects tell AWS how to connect with them and represent the phsyical on-premises routers. 
  - First open a new tab and move into the VPC console. Scroll down on the left bar menu and under **Virtual Private Network** click on **Customer Gateways** and then [Create Customer Gateways.](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=us-east-1#CreateCustomerGateway:)
  - Set the name to ONPREM-ROUTER1
  - Set the BGP ASN to 65016
  - Set the IP address to Router1Public's IP address under the CloudFormation Stack
  - Scroll down and click Create Customer Gateway
