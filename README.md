# AWS-BGP-SITE-TO-SITE-VPN

This project is a walkthrough of an **AWS BGP Site-to-Site VPN** setup, based on the original work by **Adrian Cantrill**, used under the MIT License. 
It demonstrates how to establish a **highly available, BGP-based VPN connection** between AWS and an on-premises network. 
In this project I will be creating an initial AWS environment with 2 subnets, 2 EC2 instances, a TGW and VPC attachment and a default route pointing at the TGW. 
The simulated on-premises environment - 1 public subnet, 2 private subnets. The public subnet has 2 Ubuntu + strongSwan + Free VPN endpoints.

## STAGE ONE

To first create the intial environments click on the provided [1-click deployment link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-hybrid-bgpvpn/BGPVPNINFRA.yaml&stackName=ADVANCEDVPNDEMO). Make sure to login to an AWS account with full admin permission and you're using the us-east-1 region.
