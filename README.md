# AWS-BGP-SITE-TO-SITE-VPN

This project is a walkthrough of an **AWS BGP Site-to-Site VPN** setup, based on the original work by **Adrian Cantrill**, used under the MIT License. 
It demonstrates how to establish a **highly available, BGP-based VPN connection** between AWS and an on-premises network. 
In this project I will be creating an initial AWS environment with 2 subnets, 2 EC2 instances, a TGW and VPC attachment and a default route pointing at the TGW. 
The simulated on-premises environment - 1 public subnet, 2 private subnets. The public subnet has 2 Ubuntu + strongSwan + Free VPN endpoints.

## STAGE ONE

- To first create the intial environments click on the provided [1-click deployment link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-hybrid-bgpvpn/BGPVPNINFRA.yaml&stackName=ADVANCEDVPNDEMO). Make sure to login to an AWS account with full admin permission and you're using the us-east-1 region. Once you clicked on the link scroll down to the bottom, check the box, and click create stack.
Make sure the stack has moved to a **create complete** state before moving on.

<br>

- Next we are going to be creating two customer gateway objects. These objects tell AWS how to connect with them and represent the phsyical on-premises routers. 
  - First open a new tab and move into the VPC console. Scroll down on the left bar menu and under **Virtual Private Network** click on **Customer Gateways** and then [Create Customer Gateways.](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=us-east-1#CreateCustomerGateway:)
  - Set the name to ONPREM-ROUTER1
  - Set the BGP ASN to 65016
  - Set the IP address to Router1Public's IP address under the CloudFormation Stack
  - Scroll down and click Create Customer Gateway
- We are now going to create the second customer gatweay object
  - Follow the same instructions as above but set the name to ONPREM-ROUTER2
  - Set the BGP ASN to 65016
  - Set the IP address to Router2Public's IP address under the CloudFormation Stack
  - Scroll down and click Create Customer Gateway
  - It should look like this before moving on with the IP addresses being adjust to your own

 - Now at this point we are going to verify that there is no connectivity between the AWS side and the on-premise side.
   - Move into the EC2 console and into instances
   - Click on AWS-EC2-B and copy the Private IPv4 address under details
   - Right click ONPREM-SERVER2 and click connect and use session manager to connect to the instance
   - Once connected run the command **ping IP_ADDRESS_OF_AWS_EC2-B** and there should be no response
   - Click terminate on Session Manager and that is the end of Stage 1.

<br>

This is what we have created so far

## STAGE TWO

In Stage two we will be will be creating two VPN attachments for the Transit Gateway. This has the effect of creating two VPN connections, 1 for each of the customer gateways. Each connection has 2 Tunnels: one between AWS Endpoint A => Customer Gateway and one between AWS Endpoint B => Customer Gateway.

  - To start move into the VPC console and scroll down and click on [Transit Gateway Attachments](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=us-east-1#TransitGatewayAttachments:)
    - Click Create Transit Gateway Attachment
    - Set the Transit Gateway ID to A4LTGW and the attachment type to VPN
    - Select Existing for Customer Gateway
    - Click Customer gateway ID dropdown and select ONPREM-ROUTER1
    - Click Dynamic (requires BGP) for Routing options
    - Click Enable Acceleration
    - Click Create Attachment
    - Do the same process for ONPREM-ROUTER 2
  - Now scroll back up on the left bar and click [Site-to-Site VPN](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=us-east-1#VpnConnections:)
    - In another tab above **Site-to-Site VPN** open **Customer Gateways**
    - Now match the Customer Gateway ID from **Customer Gateways** to **Site-to-Site VPN**

<br>

- On **Site-to-Site VPN** right-click on the ONPREM-ROUTER1 VPN and click download configurations
  - Change the Vendor to Generic and click download
  - Find the file you just downloaded and rename it to **CONNECTION1CONFIG.TXT**
  - Now repeat this process for ONPREM-ROUTER 2 but rename the file to **CONNECTION2CONFIG.TXT**
- At this point, we will be extracting important configuration items from the two files we have just downloaded.
  - Open the CONNECTION1CONFIG.TXT and also this [document template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/master/aws-hybrid-bgpvpn/02_INSTRUCTIONS/DemoValueTemplate.md) which will help us note down important values.
  -  There will be detailed instructions inside the document template on how to extract all of the configuration variables you will need.
  -  Finish writing down all the values inside the document template.
  -  Do this for both CONNECTION1CONFIG.TXT and CONNECTION2CONFIG.TXT
  -  This will be the end of Stage 2.

## STAGE THREE
 
In Stage 3 we will be configuring each of the on premises Ubuntu, strong Swan Routers to create IPSEC tunnels to AWS. Each Router will create 2 IPSEC tunnels each going to a different AWS Endpoint. Make sure before starting this stage that both VPN connections are in an available state. 

- First move into the EC2 console and click on instances
  - Select ONPREM-ROUTER 1 right click and then connect
  - Connect using session manager
  - Once connected type in **sudo bash** to gain root permissions
  - Then type **cd /home/ubuntu/demo_assets/**
  - Type **nano ipsec.conf**
  - Using the documents template replace **ROUTER1_PRIVATE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL1_ONPREM_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL1_AWS_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL1_AWS_OUTSIDE_IP, and, ROUTER1_PRIVATE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL2_ONPREM_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL2_AWS_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL2_AWS_OUTSIDE_IP**
  - Save your changes with **ctrl + o and ctrl + x** and then type **nano ipsec.secrets**
  - Then replace the values **CONN1_TUNNEL1_ONPREM_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL1_AWS_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL1_PresharedKey, CONN1_TUNNEL2_ONPREM_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL2_AWS_OUTSIDE_IP, CONN1_TUNNEL2_PresharedKey** with the document template values.
  - Save your changes the same way and then type **nano ipsec-vti.sh**
  - Then replace the values **CONN1_TUNNEL1_ONPREM_INSIDE_IP (ensuring the /30 is at the end), CONN1_TUNNEL1_AWS_INSIDE_IP (ensuring the /30 is at the end), CONN1_TUNNEL2_ONPREM_INSIDE_IP (ensuring the /30 is at the end), CONN1_TUNNEL2_AWS_INSIDE_IP (ensuring the /30 is at the end)**
  - Save your changes and then copy the three files to the etc directory using cp ipsec* /etc
  - Then to make the file executable use the command **chmod +x /etc/ipsec-vti.sh**
  - Then type **systemctl restart strongswan** to restart StrongSwan and type **ifconfig**
  - You should see two virtual tunnels vti1 and vti2 which means that the two tunnels are connected and active in AWS.
